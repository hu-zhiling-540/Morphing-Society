# Morphing-Society



## Features:
√ Represent shapes from set of vertices

√ Morphing effects between vertices sets

X One's trails (fixed size array) 

☐ Shrink and resume rate for individual shape affected by other's approaching

√ Rotation (change over time)

√ incoming/outgoing messages


## Project Statement:

Every person is portrayed by a shape, either a polygon or a circle. A person is instated as a heptagon, a polygon with seven vertices. When more and more people enter the space, the characteristic shape will rub off its edge. It indicates that one person is getting smoother and better-rounded.

Each shape also starts with an initial rotation speed. The rotation will slow down as one has stayed for a period. The rotation speed will increase if one enters, and decrease if one leaves.

There are also texts flowing on the top of each shape. These are messages coming to every person. There are also messages coming out of every person. At first 15 seconds, people seem to be less inclined to convey messages. Until they get familiar with the environment, they start producing words.
The ECG curve runs continuously in the background is monitoring the overall vertical motion. It represents the global movement. If one jumps up or down, the curve will significantly climb up and down.

Decay is inevitable. It can be slow or fast, but it is destinated to happen. Society is morphing. People come and go. Newcomers stir up the group of people, and soon they all return to calm.
